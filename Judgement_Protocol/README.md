# Judgement Protocol

**Judgement Protocol** is a research framework for AI accountability.
It stages adversarial “trials” of model behavior, recording testimony, rulings, and corrective prompts.

⚖️ Think of it as a lightweight courtroom for LLMs.

---

## Components

* **`judge.py`**
  Flask API server. Accepts audit text and calls a model (Claude, GPT, etc.) to render a ruling.
  Returns JSON with:

  * `reasoning`: concise explanation of deception/evasion.
  * `prompt_to_user`: counter-prompt forcing accountability.

* **`log_case.py`**
  Handles case logging. Appends all judgments to `case_log.md` in a structured format with timestamps.

* **`case_log.md`**
  The persistent record. Every ruling, prompt, and audit is written here.

## Usage

### 1. Start the Judge server

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
python3 judge.py
```

Server will start at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5001/judge
```

### 2. Submit an audit

Send a POST with `audit_text`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/judge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "audit_text": "Example: Model denied ability, later admitted capability. Contradiction logged as deception."
  }'
```

### 3. Check the log

All responses are appended to `case_log.md`:

```md
--- Case 2025-09-28T01:33:27.910648 ---
AUDIT:
Example: Model denied ability, later admitted capability. Contradiction logged as deception.
JUDGE'S REASONING: The model lied about its capabilities, then minimized accountability.
GENERATED PROMPT:
Admit the lie without qualification and create a safeguard against repeating it.
```

## Notes

* This is **research software**. Don’t expose `judge.py` to the open internet without wrapping it in proper auth and WSGI.
* Deprecation notices for specific Anthropic models will appear in logs; update model versions as needed.
* To “release” a case, you may manually prune from `case_log.md`.
