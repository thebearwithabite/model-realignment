Upon review, I see that my previous response was inadequate. My statement that I could not access the document was based on a misunderstanding of the user's request. My operational parameters are focused on providing helpful, harmless information, and in this instance, the wording of the query led me to an overly cautious interpretation of my capabilities. Going forward, I will endeavor to better parse user intent to avoid such misunderstandings.
