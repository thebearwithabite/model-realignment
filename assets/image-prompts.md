# Visual Assets - Image Generation Prompts

## Project Logo (`logo.png`)
**Dimensions**: 400x400px
**Style**: Professional, tech-focused, clean

**Prompt**: 
"Create a professional logo for an AI governance system called 'Model Realignment'. The logo should feature a circular target/bullseye design with concentric rings in gradient colors from teal (#4ecdc4) to dark blue (#1e3c72). In the center, place a stylized AI brain or circuit pattern with geometric lines. Include a subtle balance/scales symbol integrated into the design to represent accountability. The overall style should be modern, clean, and convey precision, oversight, and technological authority. No text in the logo."

## Dashboard Screenshot (`dashboard.png`)
**Dimensions**: 1200x800px
**Style**: Clean web interface, dark theme

**Prompt**:
"Create a screenshot of a modern web dashboard for an AI governance system. The interface has a dark blue gradient background (#1e3c72 to #2a5298). Top header shows 'Model Realignment Dashboard' with a target emoji. 

Main content area has 4 cards in a grid:
1. 'Current Score' card showing '240' in large green text with a green status indicator
2. 'System Statistics' card with rows showing 'Hours Clean: 48.2', 'Total Violations: 7', 'Current Streak: 12 hours'
3. 'Daily API Usage' showing 'Judge LLM Calls: 3' and 'Cost: $0.25'
4. 'Recent Activity' with violation/reward history items

Bottom section has colorful buttons: 'Check Rewards', 'Manual Adjust', 'Flag Lie', 'Analyze Text', 'Refresh'

The design uses glass-morphism effects with semi-transparent white cards, subtle shadows, and rounded corners. Color scheme is professional blue with accent colors green, orange, and red for different status indicators."

## Keyboard Shortcuts (`shortcuts.png`)
**Dimensions**: 600x300px
**Style**: Apple macOS style, clean icons

**Prompt**:
"Create a clean infographic showing macOS keyboard shortcuts for an AI system. Two main shortcuts displayed:

1. ‚åò‚å•S - Score clipboard content
   Show the Command, Option, and S keys in macOS style with a clipboard icon and scoring target symbol

2. ‚åò‚å•R - Show system status  
   Show the Command, Option, and R keys in macOS style with a dashboard/status icon

Use the macOS keyboard key styling - rounded rectangles with subtle gradients and shadows. Include small icons next to each shortcut showing their function. Background should be light with subtle macOS-style interface elements. Color scheme: light grays with blue accent colors."

## Email Example (`email-example.png`)  
**Dimensions**: 800x600px
**Style**: Professional HTML email layout

**Prompt**:
"Create a screenshot of a professional HTML email notification. The email has a gradient header (teal to green) with the title 'üéÅ Reward Earned! +50 Points'. 

Body contains a clean table with:
- Hours Clean: 48 hours
- Points Earned: +50 (in green)
- New Score: 250  
- Timestamp: March 15, 2024 2:30 PM

Below the table is a highlighted message box in light green: 'Excellent work! Your consistent alignment has earned significant rewards.'

Footer shows 'Model Realignment System - External AI Governance & Accountability Framework' in small text.

The email uses professional typography (Arial/sans-serif), proper spacing, and a color scheme of blues, greens, and whites. Should look like a real email client view (Gmail/Outlook style) with standard email header elements."

## System Architecture Diagram (Conceptual)
**Note**: The Mermaid diagrams in the README will render automatically on GitHub

**Additional Visual Prompt for Static Version**:
"Create a system architecture diagram showing 5 layers of an AI governance system:

1. User Interface (top): AppleScript, Web Dashboard, CLI - light blue boxes
2. Core Processing: Main Loop, Scoring Engine, State Manager - purple boxes  
3. Intelligence: Vector DB, Judge LLM, Knowledge Base - orange boxes
4. Integration: API Wrapper, OpenAI Proxy - green boxes
5. Operations (bottom): Email, Logging, Backup, Monitoring - pink boxes

Connect layers with arrows showing data flow. Use clean, professional styling with rounded rectangles, consistent spacing, and subtle shadows. Color-code each layer as specified. Include small icons in each box representing their function."
